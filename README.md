# simpleclassesrepo
A collection a simple classes


The purpose of this repository is to provide a set of simple classes providing simple features for simple projects.


While working on a personal project, I needed to do a simple Http request on a server I control and using libraries
like curl (or even worst, boost) to do this seems completely overkill for me. So, I made this quick and dirty code
to do so. I've already done things like that dozen of time and I'm fed up to do it again. I oftenly rewrite code
I've already done and not only in C++, so I think it will be a great thing to have a repository where you can find
simple classes you can integrate to your code without linking to a fancy library.


I'll try to add this kind of simple code then I face similar problems... I'll may add some code found elsewhere with
permissive license. So license is file specific here. The code I wrote will be probably always WTFPL.

The code provided here is quick and dirty code. It doesn't intend to be production ready. I'll try to polish it a
little. If you have comments, suggestions on it, I will be happy to takes it into account (if I have time to do so...).
